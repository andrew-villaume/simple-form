# simple-form
Recreating a simple form page from a template in HTML/CSS

Done by following the template picture in the images folder.

Good practice using basic CSS and HTML elements.  

Need to improve:
-Spacing, 49% width on the input boxes feels like a cheap and one-time-use find.  Need better answer to how I should be fitting the boxes in.
-Never added drop-down menu
-Didn't add first/last under name input, done using pseudo-classers?
-Need practice stylizing button

-Need to work on reusing code/classes, all CSS too specific?
